### Pitch

Figuring out how much you should add to the total bill for a tip, or how much everyone should pay
when ordering as a group can be difficult (even more so if you've "had a few"). Let Tipsy do the
math for you! It calculates the tip percentage, tip amount, grand total, and how much each person
should contribute when in a group. No more guess work.

### Origin

A friend of mine was using a popular mobile app for tipping and splitting bills, but it had become
so bogged down with ads that it was basically unusable. In response, I created a [free and open
source clone][nip-the-tip] for him to use instead. This is a recreation of that native Androidâ„¢ app
using web technologies.

### Usage

Tipsy is a [progressive web app][pwa], intended to be used exclusively on mobile phones. Because it
is on the web, you can access it from any device with a modern web browser - but all design choices
have been made with phone usage in mind (and particularly those with larger screens).
