# Nip the Tip

_A simple tip calculator and bill divider PWA_

Figuring out how much you should add to the total bill for a tip, or how much
everyone should pay when ordering as a group can be difficult. Nip that process
in the bud and let Nip the Tip do the math for you! It calculates the tip
percentage, tip amount, grand total, and how much each person should contribute
when in a group. No more guess work.
